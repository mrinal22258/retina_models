# Predicting Firing Rates of Retinal Ganglion Cells using Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting the firing rate of retinal ganglion cells in response to natural visual stimuli. We used the `naturalscenes.h5` dataset, which contains natural scene inputs and corresponding ganglion cell activity. Our approach leverages deep learning models tailored to the structure and behavior of biological neural systems.

## Objective

To develop and evaluate deep learning architectures that can predict the firing rates of ganglion cells given natural image stimuli.

## Models Implemented

### 1. BNCNN
A batch-normalized convolutional neural network that extracts spatial features from input patches. It applies multiple convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and activation.

### 2. CNNBiLSTM
Combines convolutional layers for feature extraction with a bidirectional LSTM layer to capture temporal dependencies or sequential correlations in the visual stimulus.

### 3. LinearStackedBNCNN
A linear model stacked on top of BNCNN features to provide a simpler but potentially interpretable prediction mechanism.
